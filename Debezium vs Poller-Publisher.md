# 🔄 Debezium vs Poller-Publisher: Which is Better for the Outbox Pattern?

When implementing the [Outbox Pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transactional-outbox.html) in a microservices architecture, there are two main strategies for publishing events to a message broker like Kafka:

- ✅ **Debezium-based CDC (Change Data Capture)**
- 🔁 **Poller-Publisher pattern**

---

## ✅ What is Debezium (CDC)?

**Debezium** is a distributed open-source platform for CDC. It listens to database transaction logs (WAL in PostgreSQL, binlog in MySQL) and pushes changes to Kafka in near real-time.

### How It Works:
1. Inserts/updates into the `outbox_event` table are captured directly from DB logs.
2. Debezium connector reads changes and transforms them using `EventRouter`.
3. Pushes events to a topic like `outbox.event.Order`.

## 🔁 What is Poller-Publisher?

This is a manual implementation where:
1. A scheduled task (poller) reads `NEW` events from the `outbox_event` table at intervals.
2. The app publishes those events to Kafka/RabbitMQ.
3. Updates event status (e.g., to `PUBLISHED` or `FAILED`).

| Feature                        | Debezium (CDC)                             | Poller-Publisher                          |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Event Delivery Latency**    | ⚡ Near real-time                           | 🕒 Delay based on poll interval            |
| **Implementation**            | Minimal code, just configure connector     | Requires code for polling, publishing     |
| **Resilience**                | Built-in retry, offset tracking            | Needs manual retry handling               |
| **Outbox Status Updates**     | Requires separate listener in service      | Done as part of the polling logic         |
| **Failure Handling**          | Robust (offset tracking, retry, DLQ)       | Error-prone unless handled carefully      |
| **Scalability**               | High, runs outside app                     | Limited by app resources                  |
| **Operational Overhead**      | Requires managing Debezium + Kafka Connect | Simpler if already using scheduled jobs   |
| **Custom Filtering**          | Supported via `transforms`                 | Fully customizable in code                |
| **Dependency on Kafka**       | Strong (Kafka-based architecture)          | Can work with any broker (Kafka, RabbitMQ)|

## ✅ When to Use Debezium

- You want **real-time** event streaming with minimal effort.
- You have Kafka and Debezium in your ecosystem.
- You prefer **low-latency, scalable** solutions.
- You want to keep **business logic decoupled** from infrastructure concerns.

---

## 🔁 When to Use Poller-Publisher

- You **do not use Kafka or Debezium**.
- You want **fine-grained control** over event generation.
- Your system already relies on scheduled jobs or batch processing.
- You need to **publish to multiple brokers** (e.g., Kafka + RabbitMQ).

## 🧠 Conclusion

| Use Case                          | Recommended Approach     |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Low-latency and scalable systems | ✅ Debezium (CDC)         |
| Legacy systems without Kafka     | 🔁 Poller-Publisher       |
| Simple setups or quick PoCs      | 🔁 Poller-Publisher       |
| Event-driven microservices       | ✅ Debezium (CDC)         |

For modern, production-grade, event-driven architectures, **Debezium-based CDC is preferred** due to its efficiency, low latency, and robustness.
